Metal HMI (Java Swing + MySQL Application)

This is a desktop application built using "Java Swing" and "MySQL", designed for managing and tracking slab data in a metal manufacturing environment. 
It allows users to "create", "read", "update" and "delete" records across two tables: "METAL_MASTER" and "METAL_DETAILS".

üßÆ Database Overview

The application uses a MySQL database named "METAL_DB", which contains two primary tables:

- METAL_MASTER ‚Äì Stores core slab metadata like SLAB_NO, HEAT_NO, STEEL_GRADE, SHIFT, etc.
- METAL_DETAILS ‚Äì Stores chemical element quantities for each slab (e.g., Al, B, Ga, In, Tl).

All slabs are uniquely identified by "SLAB_NO", which serves as a foreign key in the "METAL_DETAILS" table.
